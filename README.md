# Gerbil Scheme

Gerbil is an opinionated dialect of Scheme designed for Systems Programming,
with a state of the art macro and module system on top of the Gambit runtime
and compiler. One way to think of Gerbil is as the C++ to Marc Feeley's C.

The macro system is based on quote-syntax, and provides the full
meta-syntactic tower with a native implementation of syntax-case.
It also provides a full-blown module system, similar to PLT Scheme's
(sorry, Racket) modules. The main difference from Racket is that
Gerbil modules are single instantiation, supporting high performance
ahead of time compilation and compiled macros.

# Installation
The source code for Gerbil is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/mighty-gerbils/gerbil),
with the latest release available in [releases](https://github.com/mighty-gerbils/gerbil/releases).

Installation from source is straightforward:
```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:mighty-gerbils/gerbil.git
$ cd gerbil
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

This will install Gerbil in `/opt/gerbil`; all you have to do then is
add `/opt/gerbil/bin` to your path.

**Note** the default configuration has some dependencies you may need
to install: sqlite, zlib, and libcrypto/openssl.
You can install them in ubuntu with:
```shell
$ sudo apt install libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libsqlite3-dev
```

For more detailed installation instructions see the [Guide](https://cons.io/guide/).

# Using Gerbil
The Gerbil interpreter is `gxi`, and the compiler is `gxc`.

If you want an interactive Gerbil shell just execute the interpreter
directly by running `gxi`.

For "hello, world" see the [Guide](https://cons.io/guide/intro.html#hello-world).

# Documentation

The [documentation](https://cons.io) is a work in progress, but there are some resources
that should get you started:
- The [Introduction to Gerbil](https://cons.io/guide/intro.html) is an introductory guide
  for seasoned Schemers.
- The [Getting Started](https://cons.io/guide/getting-started.html) page covers the very basics
  of setting up your Gerbil installation and writing your first code.
- The [Gerbil Tutorial](https://cons.io/tutorials/) provides a few hands-on guides
  on Gerbil programming.
- The [Gerbil Reference Documentation](https://cons.io/reference/) is the reference documentation
  for the Gerbil runtime and standard library.

The documentation is automatically rendered online at [cons.io](https://cons.io).
You can render it locally by running `doc/build.sh`, which will leave
the html output in `doc/.vuepress/dist`; the script uses vuepress and
requires npm to be installed.

Probably the best way to dive into Gerbil is by reading the sources,
as all the main language features are exercised in one way or another
within the implementation.

Depending on your inclinations, there are several starting points:
- If you are interested in general purpose programming, then you should look at
  the [stdlib sources](src/std).
- If you are interested in Gerbil macrology, then the place to start is the [core prelude](src/gerbil/prelude/core.ss).
  This is the language that you get in the interpreter and what is available
  when writing a new module without explicitly specifying a prelude.
- If you are interested in the Gerbil expander internals, then you should look at
  the [expander sources](src/gerbil/expander).
- If you are interested in the Gerbil compiler internals, then you should look at
  the [compiler sources](src/gerbil/compiler).

# Epilogue

Gerbil had been my (vyzo) private Scheme for many years, evolved out of a set
of common macros that i used across different implementations and
eventually a full-blown PLT macro language. As such I have had
multiple backends that supported the Gerbil dialect, but I have
elected to base the canonical version of Gerbil on Gambit.

At the prompting of some friends (they know who they are), who had
seen private versions of Gerbil, I decided to release it in public
with a clean bootstrap version that bootstraps on gambit with a
precompiled version of the macro system and compiler.  That means that
the system is entirely self-hosted.

Gerbil is under continuous use and development.
The core language has been stable for a while, but we are busy porting
batteries, adding features, fixing bugs, and expanding the scope of
syntactic abstraction.

Patches (even for typos in the comments) are always welcome.
