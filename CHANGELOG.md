# Gerbil Release Notes

## Gerbil v0.18.1, NimzoLarsen

- Gerbil v0.18.1; December 5, 2023

**TL;DR** Gerbil v0.18.1 is a patch release,
that consolidates the foundations laid out by v0.18 and fixes minor bugs,
paving the way for Gerbil v1.0 in the near future.
Since this is a patch for the v0.18 **Nimzowitsch** release, we call it
NimzoLarsen after the most famous Chess opening popularized by
Nimzowitsch.

As notable new features:
- `:std/net/s3` is a S3 client (for remote data storage on e.g. AWS)
- `:std/net/smtp` is an SMTP client (for sending email), and
- `:std/db/postgresql` now supports SSL (notably enabling Gerbil on Heroku).

Also, the library `:std/getopt` was moved to `:std/cli/getopt`
(old name available as an alias), next to new CLI modules:
`:std/cli/multicall` (multicall programs),
`:std/cli/print-exit` (display Scheme results to CLI),
`:std/cli/shell` (escape strings for Unix shells).

A lot of standard library modules, many of them added just before v0.18,
were tested, documented, fixed, tweaked and/or extended with new functionality:
`:std/error`, `:std/debug/DBG` (great for "print-debugging"), `:std/io`,
`:std/misc/bytes`, `:std/misc/evector` (extensible vectors), `:std/misc/list`,
`:std/misc/number`, `:std/misc/ports`, `:std/misc/prime`, `:std/misc/process`,
`:std/misc/string`, `:std/misc/vector`, `:std/net/json-rpc`, `:std/os/error`,
`:std/parser/ll1` (LL(1) parser combinators, nÃ©e `:std/text/basic-parsers`),
`:std/pregexp`, `:std/sugar`, `:std/text/char-set`.

The runtime exports a few more functions (`vector-ref-set!`, `fx>=0` and such),
and a few bugs were fixed (#1048, #1064).

Last but not least, upgrading the Gambit embedded in Gerbil (#1030) fixed
a long-standing issue with [`letrec*`](https://github.com/gambit/gambit/issues/659),
also affected Gerbil's `def` (that expands to it), causing evaluation to be
reordered in sometimes incorrect way wrt the order of expressions in the source.
Un-reordering of code evaluations may also surprisingly affect correct code:
e.g. unit-tests in Glow depended on a given evaluation order in the compiler,
and broke when the reordering of some evaluations didn't happen anymore.

## Gerbil v0.18, Nimzowitsch

- Gerbil v0.18; October 12, 2023
- Gerbil v0.18-rc1; October 6, 2023

**TL;DR** Gerbil v0.18 is a milestone release, which sets the
**foundation** for Gerbil v1.0 in the near future. We affectionately
call it the **Nimzowitsch** release, after the great Chess player who
formulated the basis of modern Chess theory.

There have been cataclysmic changes, as we have finally achieved full
self hosting bootstrap (the Bootstrap Singularity) and the entirety of
the language is written in itself. Gambit is now integrated as a git
submodule, with the only dependency being on `libgambit` and `gsc` as
the compiler backend.  `gsi` is only needed for the bootstrap
compilation, after that is out of the picture and we don't even
install it.

The build system has been reworked from the ground up. We start from
the precompiled bootstrap sources, which we compile with a build
script using `gsi`.  The bootstrap compiler then compiles the runtime,
the expander and the prelude, and after that we build the universal
`gerbil` binary to build the rest of the system.
All this is described in detail in
[The Gerbil Bootstrap](https://cons.io/reference/dev/bootstrap.html).

The executable compilation model has been also reworked from the
ground up.  Gone are the dynamic executable stubs, we don't need them
any more as you can just run any dynamically compiled executable
module with the `gerbil` binary. Instead all executables are proper
binaries which either link to `libgerbil` and `libgambit` (as shared
libraries by default, or baked into the binary if the system is
configured with `--disable-shared`) or compiled with full program
optimization, which is akin to the old static binary compilation
model. The nomenclature has also changed, as the dynamic -vs- static
distinction refers to the _linkage_ of the executable, in line with
the native system toolchain.

The runtime has been rewritten in pure Gerbil; gone are the `gx-gambc`
gambit "modules" that provided the core runtime functionality. This
has allowed us great freedom and some very important features. We have
completely reworked the exception hierarchy to be class based and we
define our own versions of `raise`, `with-exception-handler` and
`with-catch` and ensure that all exceptions have stack traces. We have
also lifted all restrictions with regards to embedding the expander in
binary executables.  The code is there in libgerbil, and you can just
load the expander environment on demand.

The tooling has been greatly improved, with emphasis on build
isolation so that each individual project has its own GERBIL_PATH
bundling dependencies and solving once and for all the dirty
`~/.gerbil` problem that plagued earlier version of Gerbil. The
tooling improvements don't stop there of course, see [Getting Started
with Gerbil Development](https://cons.io/guide/getting-started.html),
[The Gerbil Universal Binary and
Tools](https://cons.io/reference/dev/bach.html), and [The Gerbil Build
Tool](https://cons.io/reference/dev/build.html) for more details. The
package manager has also been greatly enhanced to support a
distributed directory model and semantic versioning for dependencies;
see [The Gerbil Package
Manager](https://cons.io/guide/package-manager.html) for more details.

Speaking of tooling, we now have a dedicated test running tool which
can run your tests in the command line and works similar to `go
test`. This has allowed us to greatly increase our development
velocity and bring an "always test" mentality to Gerbil
development. You no longer have to stand in your head to run your
tests, you just write them and run them with `gerbil test`.

Moving on to linguistic and standard library changes, there is a
monumental shift with the introduction of _interfaces_, which are akin
to type-classes and similar to Go's interfaces. In short, interfaces
allow us to create facades to complex functionality and complete our
object orientation story. See
[Interfaces](https://cons.io/guide/intro.html#interfaces) in the guide
and [Interfaces](https://cons.io/reference/std/interface.html) in the
reference documentation.

Introducing interfaces allowed us to bring on the [Standard IO
Interfaces](https://cons.io/reference/std/stdio.html) and completely
redefine the way we do IO in Gerbil. This allowed us to rewrite almost
everything that touches IO in the standard library, with cleaner and
more performant code.

Moving on from IO, the Actor package in the standard library has been
rewritten from scratch and brings a simpler and more powerful low
level protocol and very important new functionality for managing actor
ensembles. See [Actors](https://cons.io/guide/intro.html#actors) in
the guide, the all new [Working with Actor
Ensembles](https://cons.io/tutorials/ensemble.html) tutorial, and the
[:std/actor](https://cons.io/reference/std/actor.html)  package in the
reference documentation.

Another very important change, also enabled by interfaces, is the full
on embrace of openssl3 in the standard library; see [TLS/SSL
Sockets](https://cons.io/reference/std/net/ssl.html) in the reference
documentation. Everything that uses the [socket
interfaces](https://cons.io/reference/std/stdio.html#sockets) can also
transparently use SSL, with the added ability to upgrade existing
sockets after negotiation.

Following that, the
[httpd](https://cons.io/reference/std/net/httpd.html) can natively
serve requests over SSL without needing a front end proxy like
`nginx`.

Naturally, the [request
library](https://cons.io/reference/std/net/request.html) has been
rewriten internally to utilize interfaces, and so has the
[protobuf](https://cons.io/reference/std/protobuf.html) library.

We also have completely rewritten
[WebSockets](https://cons.io/reference/std/net/websocket.html#websocket-interface)
and [SOCKS](https://cons.io/reference/std/net/socks.html) libraries,
now with server side support.

JSON RPC has also become a first class citizen, with both client and
server-side support. See [JSON
RPC](https://cons.io/reference/std/net/json-rpc.html) in the reference
documentation for details.

Other than that, we also have a lot of new code integrated in the
standard library, graduating from its
[gerbil-utils](https://github.com/mighty-gerbils/gerbil-utils/)
incubation.

We have also refactored out libraries with foreign dependencies that
were not built by default into external packages, listed in the
[mighty gerbils
directory](https://github.com/mighty-gerbils/gerbil-directory). This
includes the `libxml`, `leveldb`, `lmdb`, and `leveldb` lbiraries.

And last but not least, we introduced [Contracts and Type
Annotations](https://cons.io/reference/std/contract.html). Contracts
can be attached to interfaces or enacted by the all powerful `using`
macro with the meta-linguistic ability to perform dotted access for
interface calls and struct and class accessors and mutators.  This
greatly reduces boilerplate and makes the code much more pleasant to
read.  See the [Proxies](https://cons.io/tutorials/proxy.html)
tutorial for the natural progression culminating in the `using` macro.

Of course this is just the bird's eye view of the changes; see the
[release
notes](https://github.com/mighty-gerbils/gerbil/releases/tag/v0.18-rc1)
for the full changelog pointing to every pr commited in this
development cycle.

In conclusion, it is safe to say that at this point Gerbil is
approaching production readiness; you should already be able to use it
in production for experimental and non-mission critical projects
without fear.  See [Developing Software with
Gerbil](https://cons.io/reference/dev/).

Happy Hacking!
