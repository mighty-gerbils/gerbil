# Exceptions and Errors

The `:std/error` library provides base classes for exceptions and errors.

::: tip usage
(import :std/error)

## The root of the hierarchy

The exception hierarchy is rooted in two base classes: `Error` and `Exception`.
- Instances of `Error` indicate error conditions, and they have a
  standard payload of a message, a subsystem or procedure name where
  the error originated, and a list of irritants.
  `Error` mixes in `StackTrace` which allows the system to fill stack traces
  -- see `raise` below.
- Instances of `Exception` indicate exceptional conditions that are
  not necessarily errors, and do not have a standard payload.
  `Exception` does not mix `StackTrace`, as it is possible to use `Exception`
  instances for control flow, in which case it would be inappropriate to include
  stack traces without the programmer's consent.

### Exception
```scheme
(defclass Exception ...)
```

The base class for naked exception objects; there are no fields or slots in this class.

### Exception?
```scheme
(Exception? obj)
```

Predicate for `Exception` instances

### RuntimeException
```scheme
(defclass (RuntimeException Exception ...) ...)
```

Wrapper class for exceptions generated by the gambit runtime, such
that a stack trace can be attached.

The original exception is available at the `exception` slot.

### RuntimeException?
```scheme
(RuntimeException? obj)
```

Predicate for `RuntimeException` instances.

### StackTrace
```scheme
(defclass StackTrace (continuation))
```

Mixin class for stack traces in errors.

If an exception class that mixes in `StackTrace` is raised by this module's
redefined `raise` (see below), then the current continuation will be
captured (if not already captured) and stored in the `continuation`
slot. The continuation backtrace will be displayed by
`Error::display-exception` to facilitate debugging.


### StackTrace?
```scheme
StackTrace?
```

Predicate for `StackTrace` mixins.


### Error
```scheme
(defclass (Error StackTrace ...) ...)

(Error message irritants: (irritants []) where: (where #f))
```
The base class for errors.

The constructor takes a required argument (`message`) and two optional keyword arguments:
- `message`; this the error message to display to the user.
- `irritants`; this is a list of objects related to the error condition.
- `where`; this is usually a symbol (may be false) indicating the source of the error.

### Error?
```scheme
(Error? obj)
```

Predicate for `Error` instances.

### Error-message
```scheme
(Error-message err) -> string
  err := instance of Error
```

Accessor for the error message.

### Error-irritants
```scheme
(Error-irritants err) -> list
  err := instance of Error
```

Accessor for the error irritants.

### Error-where
```scheme
(Error-where err) -> any
  err := instance of Error
```

Accessor for the error origin.

### Error:::init!
```scheme
(Error:::init! err message irritants: (irritants []) where: (where #f))
  err := instance of Error
```

The base `Error` constructor, which error subclasses can call to
initialize the base error reprsentation.

### Error::display-exception
```scheme
(Error::display-exception err port)
  err  := instance of Error
  port := output port
```

Base method for displaying Errors, including a stack trace if
available; see `StackTrace` below.


## Standard Error Classes

The following are predefined classes with standard semantics, used
througout the standard library.

### ContractViolation
```scheme
(defclass (ContractViolation StackTrace Error) ())
```

Error indicating an input parameter contract violation condition.

### ContractViolation?
```scheme
(ContractViolation? exn)
```

Predicate testing whether the error is a contract violation condition.

### contract-violation-error?
```scheme
(def contract-violation-error! ContractViolation?)
```

Same as `ContractViolation?`.

### IOError
```scheme
(defclass (IOError StackTrace Error) ())
```

Error indicating an IO condition.

### IOError?
```scheme
(IOError? exn)
```

Predicate testing whether the error is an IO condition.

### io-error?
```scheme
(def io-error? IOError?
```

same as `IOError?`

### PrematureEndOfInput
```scheme
(defclass (PrematureEndOfInput IOError) ())
```

Error indicating that input was exhausted prematurely; similar to EOF
exceptions in other languages.

### PrematureEndOfInput?
```scheme
(PrematureEndOfInput? obj)
```

Predicate testing whether the error is a premature end of input condition.

### premature-end-of-input-error?
```scheme
(def permature-end-of-input? PrematureEndOfInput?)
```

Same as `PrematureEndOfInput?`.

### IOClosed
```scheme
(deferror-class (IOClosed IOError))
```

Error indicating that the IO sink or source has been closed and thus
no further IO operations can be performed.

### IOClosed?
```scheme
(IOClosed? obj)
```

Predicate testing whether the error is an IO closed condition.

### io-closed-error?
```scheme
(def io-closed-error? IOClosed?)
```

Same as `IOClosed?`.

### Timeout
```scheme
(deferror-class Timeout)
```

Error indicating that some operation has timed out.

### Timeout?
```scheme
(Timeout? obj)
```

Predicate testing whether the error is a timeout.

### timeout-error?
```scheme
(def timeout-error? Timeout?)
```

Same as `Timeout?`.

### ContextError
```scheme
(deferror-class ContextError)
```

Error indicating that some operation was performed out of context.

### ContextError?
```scheme
(ContextError? obj)
```

Predicate testing whether the error is a context error

### context-error?
```scheme
(def context-error? ContextError?)
```

Same as `ContextError?`.

### UnboundKey
```scheme
(deferror-class UnboundKey)
```

Error indicating that some lookup operation failed because a key was unbound.

### UnboundKey?
```scheme
(UnboundKey? obj)
```

Predicate testing whether the condition is an unbound key error

### unbound-key-error?
```scheme
(def unbound-key-error? UnboundKey?)
```

Same as `UnboundKey?`.

## Raising exceptions

The library redefines `raise` and `error` so that it fills stack
traces where appropriate.
It also provides some utility procedure for raising particular errors
without caring about the particulars of the condition system.

### error
```scheme
(error message irritant ...)
```

Like basic Scheme's `error`, but raises with stack trace.

### raise
```scheme
(raise exn)
```

Raises an exception condition.

If the exception object is an instance of `StackTrace`, then unless
there is already a continuation because this is a re-raise, the
continuation is captured and stored in the `continuation` slot.

### check-argument
```scheme
(check-argument expr expectation argument)
  expr := a boolean expression
  expectation := a string describing the expectation
  argument := the argument being checked for reporting purposes.
```

Evaluates the boolean expression `expr` and raises a contract violation if it is `#f`.

### raise-contract-violation
```scheme
(raise-contract-violation where contract irritant ...)
```

Raises a `ContractViolation` condition.

### raise-io-error
```scheme
(raise-io-error where message . irritants)
```

Raises an `IOError` condition.

### raise-premature-end-of-input
```scheme
(raise-premature-end-of-input where . irritants)
```
p
Raises a `PrematureEndOfInput` condition.

### raise-io-closed
```scheme
(raise-io-closed where message . irritants)
```

Raises an `IOClosed` condition.

### raise-timeout
```scheme
(raise-timeout where message . irritants)
```

Raises a `Timeout` condition.

### raise-context-error
```scheme
(raise-context-error where message . irritants)
```

Raise a `ContextError` condition.

### raise-key-error
```scheme
(raise-key-error where message . irritants)
```

Raise a `KeyError` condition.

## BUGS

Sometimes something that really shouldn't happen, but it did; because, Murphy.

### BUG
```scheme
(BUG where message . irritants)
```

Raise a bug condition.

### is-it-bug?
```scheme
(is-it-bug? obj)
```

Checks whether an error condition was caused by a something unexpected, a bug.

## Defining custom Error classes

The library offers a utility macro to define error classes that follow
the standard library conventions. You don't have to use it, but if you
are building a library it is recommended to do so.

### deferror-class
```scheme
(deferror-class Class slots predicate-alias [constructor = Error:::init!])
(deferror-class (Class Mixin ...) slots predicate-alias [constructor = Error:::init!])
```

The first form defines a class `Class` with slots `slots` that extends
`Error`, mixing in `StackTrace`.  It also defines a predicate alias
for the class's instance predicate that can be exported to hide the
internal error details.

## Dumping stack traces

It is useful to invoke a thunk and dump an exception stack trace if it
raises; this can be accomplished with the `with-exception-stack-trace`
and `dump-stack-trace!` utility procedures.

This can be useful when you are dealing with exceptions that do not
mixin `StackTrace` (which will automatically dump the stack trace when
displaying the exception with `display-exception`).

### with-exception-stack-trace
```scheme
(with-exception-stack-trace thunk (error-port (current-error-port)))
```

Invokes `thunk` with an exception handler that dumps the exception
stack trace with `dump-stack-trace!`
if `(dump-stack-trace?)` is true (the default).

### dump-stack-trace?
```scheme
(define dump-stack-trace? (make-parameter #t))
```
A parameter that controls whether `with-exception-stack-trace`
will actually dump a stack trace to standard error.

You can `(dump-stack-trace? #f)`
or locally `(parameterize ((dump-stack-trace? #f)) ...)`
to disable this stack trace dump,
in case you are building a program for end-users rather than for developers,
and want to control what limited error output they see.
Or you can re-enable them based on a debug flag at the CLI
in cases you want them to provide you with extra debugging information.

### dump-stack-trace!
```scheme
(dump-stack-trace! cont exn (error-port (current-error-port)))
```

Displays the exception `exn`, dumping the stack trace of continuation
`cont` if there is no stack trace information in the exception itself.

### exit-with-error
```scheme
(exit-with-error exception) => [exit]
```
Display the `exception` to current error port and exit with error code 2.

### exit-on-error?
```scheme
(def exit-on-error? (make-parameter #t))
```
This parameter controls whether `call-with-exit-on-error`, `with-exit-on-error`,
`call-with-getopt`, and any function that indirectly uses them,
will exit if an error is caught, rather than pass on the error
and return to the REPL (or let a more fundamental function exit).

### call-with-exit-on-error
```scheme
(call-with-exit-on-error thunk)
```
Calls the `thunk` in an environment wherein if an error is caught and
`(exit-on-error)` is true, `exit-with-error` will be called,
causing an error message to be printed and the process to exit with exit code 2.
If `(exit-on-error)` is false, the error will simply be raised again.

This mechanism enables users to modify the parameter
(e.g. via a flag passed at the Unix CLI or a change made at the Scheme REPL)
and control whether to exit with an error (e.g. for end-users)
or enter a debugger REPL (e.g. for developers).

### with-exit-on-error
```scheme
(with-exit-on-error body ...)
```
Evaluates the `body` as in a `thunk` passed to `call-with-exit-on-error`.
