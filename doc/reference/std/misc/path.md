# Path Utilities

The `:std/misc/path` library provides functions that complement those
inherited from Gambit in making it easy to manipulate POSIX-style file paths.
At this time, we make no pretense of supporting Windows-style paths;
if on Windows, use WSL or Cygwinâ€”or help improve Gerbil to be more portable.

::: tip To use the bindings from this module:
``` scheme
(import :std/misc/path)
```
:::

## path-default-extension
```scheme
(path-default-extension path ext) -> path
```

Add a default extension to a path:
given a `path` (string) and an extension `ext` (a string
starting with `"."`, or `""` or `#f` for no extension),
if the `ext` start with `"."` and the `path` has no extension
(as per `path-extension`), then return the concatenation
of the `path` and `ext`, otherwise return `path` unmodified.

::: tip Examples:
``` scheme
> (path-default-extension "foo.ss" ".o")
"foo.ss"
> (path-default-extension "foo" ".o")
"foo.o"
> (path-default-extension "foo" #f)
"foo"
```
:::

## path-force-extension
```scheme
(path-force-extension path ext) -> path
```

Add a extension to a path:
given a `path` (string) and an extension `ext` (a string
starting with `"."`, or `""` for the empty extension,
or `#f` for no actual extension to force),
if `ext` is false, then return `path` unmodified,
otherwise, return a next string computed by
stripping any current extension from the `path`,
and replacing it with the provided extension `ext`
(which may be `""` at which point nothing is added to the stripped path).

Note how the semantics of `#f` and `""` differ here,
unlike in `path-default-extension`.

Also note that if a filename starts with `"."` (after disregarding any
`"/"`-delimited directory before it), then
that `"."` does not count as part of an extension;
however, there might be more than one `"."` in the filename, at which point
only the last one is considered as starting "the" extension,
but what comes before might suddenly become the extension if `ext` is `""`.
However, these are corner cases that shouldn't matter most of the time.

::: tip Examples:
``` scheme
> (path-force-extension "foo.ss" ".o")
"foo.o"
> (path-force-extension "foo" ".o")
"foo.o"
> (path-force-extension "foo.ss" #f)
"foo.ss"
> (path-force-extension "foo.ss" "")
"foo"
```
:::

## path-extension-is?
```scheme
(path-extension-is? path extension) -> bool
```

Return true if the given `path` has the given `extension`.

::: tip Examples:
``` scheme
> (path-extension-is? "foo.ss" ".ss")
#t
> (path-extension-is? "foo" "")
#t
> (path-extension-is? "foo.c" "") ;; Nope, extension is ".c"
#f
> (path-extension-is? ".foo" ".foo") ;; Nope, initial "." doesn't count.
#f
> (path-extension-is? "foo.b.c" ".b.c") ;; Nope, the extension is just ".c"
#f
> (path-extension-is? "foo.ss" "")
#f
```

## subpath
```scheme
;; : String String ... -> String
(subpath top . sub-components)
```

## subpath?
```scheme
;; : (OrFalse String) (OrFalse String) -> (OrFalse String)
(subpath? maybe-subpath base-path)
```
If `maybe-subpath` is a pathname that is under `base-path`, return a pathname object that
when used with `path-expand` with defaults `base-path`, yields `maybe-subpath`.
Otherwise, return `#f`.

## path-absolute?
```scheme
;; : String -> Bool
(path-absolute? path)
```

## absolute-path?
```scheme
;; : Any -> Bool
(absolute-path? path)
```

## get-absolute-path
```scheme
;; : (Or String False (-> String)) -> String
(get-absolute-path path-designator)
```

Return the absolute path associated to a `path-designator`:
  - A string designates itself.
  - A thunk designates the result of calling it.
  - `#f` designates the `(current-directory)`.

Throw an error if the designator is invalid or does not designate an absolute path.

## ensure-absolute-path
```scheme
;; : String (Or String False (-> String)) -> String
(ensure-absolute-path path (base #f))
```

Given a `path`, that may be absolute, or may be relative to a `base`,
try hard to return the absolute path that this `path` would designate
if used to open a file relative to the `base`.

The `base` itself may be a string denoting a path that is or isn't absolute,
or may be `#f` which denotes the `(current-directory)`,
or may be a thunk that returns a string
(that may itself some path relative to `(current-directory)`, or some other
default extracted from some environment variable or other configuration).

## path-maybe-normalize
```scheme
;; : String -> String
(path-maybe-normalize path)
```

Try to `path-normalize` the given `path`, but if that fails, falls back to
using `path-simplify` to at least simplify the path as much as possible.

There are many reasons why `path-normalize` may fail:
  - The file doesn't exist, and so cannot have a canonical name.
  - Along the path there may be symlinks in unreadable directories,
    "interesting" filesystems that defy introspection,
    weird `chroot` situations, etc.
  - Race conditions with other threads or processes modifying the
    system rights at the same moment may cause `path-normalize`
    to yield inconsistent results.

So you may want to gracefully fall back to a non-normalized yet simplified path
when that's the case.

## path-enough
```scheme
;; : String String -> String
(path-enough sub base)
```

If `sub` is a pathname that is under `base`, return a pathname string that
when used with `path-expand` with defaults `base`, returns `sub`.
Otherwise, return `sub` unchanged.

This function is broadly similar to the Common Lisp standard function
`enough-namestring`, or its semi-standard library variant `uiop:enough-pathname`.

## path-simplify-directory
```scheme
;; : String -> String
(path-simplify-directory path)
```

Given a `path`, keep only its directory portion, and simplify it.

## path-normalized-directory
```scheme
;; : String -> String
(path-normalized-directory path)
```

Given the `path` to a directory that exists, return the normalized path
to that directory.

## path-parent
```scheme
;; : String -> String
(path-parent path)
```

## path-simplify
```scheme
;; : String keep..?:Bool -> String
(path-simplify path keep..?: (keep..? #f))
```

Given a `path` to a file that may or may not exist on the current filesystem,
return a simplified path, eliminating redundant uses of `"."` or `"/"`.

Unless `keep..?` is true, also remove `".."` path components that follow
a non-`".."` path component, which is usually a valid simplification,
but may fail to preserve subtle behavior such as:
  - Deliberately following a symlink then going up from the target directory
  - Simplifying away an attempt to follow a directory that may or may not exist
    as a back-handed way to detect whether it exists or not.
  - Weird behavior that may happen due to filesystem mounts.

NB: Always simplify away a trailing `"/"` except for the root directory `"/"`.
