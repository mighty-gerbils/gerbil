# Command Line Argument Parsing

This is the old name of the [`:std/cli/getopt`](cli/getopt.md) module,
that provides facilities for command line argument parsing.

Up to Gerbil v0.18, `:std/getopt` was the only name for this module.
Up to and including Gerbil v0.19, both names are supported.
However, we recommend you use the new name `:std/cli/getopt` from now on,
as we may remove the old name at some point in the future.

::: tip usage
```scheme
(import :std/cli/getopt)
```
