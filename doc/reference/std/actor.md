## Messaging Primitives

### ->
```scheme
(-> dest msg
    replyto: (replyto #f)
    expiry: (expiry #f)
    reply-expected: (reply-expected? #f))
```
Sends a message to `dest`, which must be a thread or actor handle, wrapped in an envelope.
- `replyto` is an optional nonce when sending a reply to a previous message.
- `expiry` is an optional expiry time (as a time object), which denotes the expiry of the
   message. Expired messages will not be processed by the reaction macro `<-` below.
- `reply-expected?` is a boolean indicated whether a reply is expected to this message.
   It is a hint for message routers to send back a control reply in case of routing
   errors.
Returns the nonce of the message or `#f` if the message was not sent because the destination
actor was detected as dead.

### ->>
```scheme
(->> dest msg
     replyto: (replyto #f)
     timeout: (timeo (default-reply-timeout)))
```
Sends a message to dest and waits for the reply.
- `replyto` is an optional nonce indicating a reply to a previous interaction.
- `timeout` is the timeout for receiving the reply, which must be a relative time (a positive real) or an absolute time (a time object).

Returns the value received in the reply message.

Raises an actor error if the message could not be sent because the destination was detected
as dead.

Raises a timeout error if waiting for the reply times out.

### -->
```scheme
(--> result)
```

Sends result as a reply to the source of the message in the current
reaction context; it must be invoked within the lexical scope of a
`<-` reaction.

### -->?
```scheme
(-->? result)
```

Conditionally sends result as a reply to the source of the message in
the current reaction context, if a reply is expected; it must be
invoked within the lexical scope of a `<-` reaction.

### <-
```scheme
(<- (pattern body ...) ...
    [,(reaction-rule-macro ...) ...]
    [,@(multiple-reaction-rules-macro ...) ...]
    [timeout: timeo]
    [(else body ...)])
```

Receives an enveloped message from the thread's mailbox matching one
of the patterns and dispatching the body accordingly; patterns are
matched with `match`.

If there is a timeout specified, it will raise a timeout error if no
message matching any of the patterns is received before the timeout
elapses.

If there is an `else` clause it will be dispatched immediately if
there is no message matching any of the patterns in the mailbox.

Within a reaction rule body, the following syntactic variables are set:
- `@envelope` is set to the message envelope; this is an instance of the `evenelope` struct.
- `@message`  is set to the envelope payload; this can be anything.
- `@dest`     is set to the envelope destination; this is where the message was sent, a thread or a handle.
- `@source`   is set to the envelope source; this is where the message came from, a thread or a handle.
- `@nonce`    is set to the envelope nonce; a monotonically increasing nonnegative integer.
- `@replyto`  is set to the envelope reply nonce; it can be #f if this message is not a reply to a previous message, or the nonce of a previously sent message.
- `@expiry`   is set to the envelope expiry; this is a `time` object, representing absolute expiration time.
- `@reply-expected?` is set to the envelope reply-expected hint; this is #t if the source is expecting a reply to this message.

### <<
```scheme
(<< (pattern body ...) ...
    [timeout: timeo]
    [(else body ...)])
```

Like `<-` but it destructures raw messages that can be anything, not
necessarily wrapped in an envelope. You don't normally have to use
this unless you are expecting to receive messages sent with a raw
primitive like `thread-send` or `send-message` and not with the send
operator(s).

There are no syntactic variables bound in the reaction context.

### envelope
```scheme
(defstruct envelope (message dest source nonce replyto expiry reply-expected?)
 ...)
```

Envelope structure for messages; you normally shouldn't construct
those by hand and let the send operators construct it for you.

The structure is provided so that you program raw reactions with `<<`,
for instance when writing a proxy actor.

The meanings and types of the struct fields are as defined as follows:
- `message`  is the payload; this can be anything.
- `dest`     is the destination actor; this is where the message was sent, a thread or a handle.
- `source`   is the source of the message; this is where the message came from, a thread or a handle.
- `nonce`    is the source-specific message nonce; a monotonically increasing nonnegative integer.
- `replyto`  is the destination-specific reply nonce; it can be #f if this message is not a reply to a previous message, or the nonce of a previously sent message.
- `expiry`   is envelope expiry; this is a `time` object, representing absolute expiration time.
- `reply-expected?` is hint for proxies; this is #t if the source is expecting a reply to this message.


### send-message
```scheme
(send-message actor msg)
```

Sends a message to an actor, which must be a thread or a handle.
Returns `#f` if the message was not sent because the actor was detected as dead.

You don't normally have to invoke this, it is invoked internally by
the send operators.  It is provided however in case you want to send
pre-constructed envelopes, for instance when writing a proxy actor.

### current-thread-nonce!
```scheme
(current-thread-nonce!)
```

Returns the current thread's numeric nonce and post increments.

You don't normally have to use this procedure, the nonce is
incremented automatically by the send operators. It is provided
however in case you want to construct your own envelopes, for instance
when writing a proxy actor.

### actor-authorized?
```scheme
(actor-authorized? actor)
```

Returns true if the actor (a thread or a handle) are authorized for administrative actions.

All threads within the process are implicitly authorized.

Remote actors must be authorized with the actor server using
`admin-authorize` if the actor server requires authentication.  This
happens by default if an administrative public key exists in the
ensemble directory. If none exists, the actor server will consider all
actors in the ensemble as authorized.

### actor-error
```scheme
(defstruct (actor-error <error>) ())
```

Structure for actor errors.

### raise-actor-error
```scheme
(raise-actor-error where what . irritants)
```

Raises an actor error.

### default-reply-timeout
```scheme
(default-reply-timeout)
```

The default reply timeout in seconds; initial value is 5s.

### set-default-reply-timeout!
```scheme
(set-default-reply-timeout! timeo)
```
Sets the default reply timeout.


## Handles and References

### make-handle
```scheme
(handle proxy ref)
```

Creates a handle for sending messages to an actor through a proxy.
- `proxy` is the actor who will receive the messages, a thread.
- `ref` is a `reference` to the actor being proxied; in general it is
  something the proxy can interpret; see `reference` below.

### handle?
```scheme
(handle? obj)
```

Predicate for handles.


### handle-proxy
```scheme
(handle-proxy h)
```

Returns the proxy in the handle.

### handle-ref
```scheme
(handle-ref h)
```

Returns the actor reference in the handle.

### reference
```scheme
(defmessage reference (server id))
```

References for actors in the ensemble.
- `server` is the server identifier where the actor resides.
- `id` is the actor identifier, generally a symbol for references by name.


### reference->handle
```scheme
(reference->handle ref (srv (current-actor-server)))
```

Creates a handle from a reference, using by default the current actor
server as the proxy.


## Protocols

### defmessage
```scheme
(defmessage id (field-name ...) struct-options ...)
```

Macro to define message types that can be efficiently marshalled as
protocol messages.

The structure is final and transparent, and it is automatically
registered in the message type registry where the unmarshaller can
find it.

::: tip Note
Messages _must_ be acyclic; if you want to send cyclic data you
can use a normal struct, but be aware that such structs will be
serialized/deserialized with the raw gambit serializer and carry the
whole type descriptor (including methods) with them.
:::

### message?
```scheme
(message? obj)
```

Predicate for instances of messages defined with `defmessage`.

### defcall-actor
```scheme
(defcall-actor (proc arg ...)
  expr
  [error: error-msg error-irritant ...])
```

Macro for defining synchronous interaction entry points for actors.

The macro defines a procedure that invokes an actor with `expr` and
unwraps the result.  If it is `!ok` the embedded value is returned.  If
it is `!error` an actor error is raised, using the optional error
message and irritants specified in the definition.

### !ok
```scheme
(defmessage !ok (value))
```

Message indicating a successful invocation of an actor.

### !error
```scheme
(defmessage !error (message))
```

Message indicating an error in an actor invocation. The message is a
diagnostic string, that will be included in the error raised by
`defcall-actor` definitions.

### with-result
```scheme
(with-result expr [fail!])
```

Evaluates `expr` and matches the result; if it is `!ok` the embedded
value is returned.  If it is `!error` an error is raised by invoking
the `fail!` (`error` by default) procedure with the error message.


## Actor Management Protocol

### !ping
```scheme
(defmessage !ping ())
```

Message sent to check liveness of an actor; the actor must reply with
`(!ok 'OK)` if it is live.

### @ping
```scheme
(defrule (@ping)
  ((!ping) (--> (!ok 'OK))))
```

Reaction macro to automatically respond to `!ping` messages.

You can use this in reaction context (`<-`) with the gnostic `,(@ping)` syntax.


### !shutdown
```scheme
(defmessage !shutdown ())
```

Message sent to request an actor to gracefully shutdown.

### @shutdown
```scheme
(defrule (@shutdown exit ...)
  ((!shutdown)
   (-->? (!ok (void)))
   exit ...))
```

Reaction macro to automatically (conditionally) respond to a `!shutdown` message.

You can use this in reaction context (`<-`) with the gnostic
`,(@shutdown exit-actor-loop ...)` syntax.

### @unexpected
```scheme
(defrule (@unexpected logf)
  (unexpected
   (logf "unexpected message from ~a: ~a" @source @message)
   (-->? (!error "unexpected message"))))
```

Reaction macro to automatically log and conditionally respond to unexpected messages.

You can use this in reaction contex (`<-`) with the gnostic
`,(@unexpected warnf)` syntax.


### Tickers

#### ticker
```scheme
(ticker peer (period 1) (tick 'tick))
```

Runs in a loop sending `!tick` messages to `peer` every elapsed `period` (in seconds).

You can spawn tickers to send heartbeat messages to an actor like this:
```scheme
(spawn/name 'ticker ticker (current-thread))
```

#### ticker-after
```scheme
(ticker-after peer initial-delay (period 1) (tick 'tick))
```

Runs `ticker` after sleeping for `initial-delay` (in seconds).

#### after
```scheme
(after time peer (tick 'tick))
```

Sleeps for `time` and sends a tick to the specified peer.

#### !tick
```scheme
(defmessage !tick (id seqno))
```

This is the message sent by `ticker` and related procedures to signify a temporal tick.
- `id` is the identifier of the tick, which is a hint for actors to
  demultiplex multiple tick sources.
- `seqno` is the sequence number of the tick.


### Actor Monitors

#### actor-monitor
```scheme
(actor-monitor actor peer (send ->))
```

Waits for `actor` to terminate by joining it and sends an
`!actor-dead` message to `peer` when it exits. The `actor` must be a
thread.

The `send` procedure is used to send the message; if you are
processing raw messages with `<<` in your actor's reaction loop, you
can use `send-message` instead of `->` to avoid wrapping the
notification in an envelope.

You can spawn an actor monitor to notify you of thread exits like this:
```scheme
(spawn/name 'actor-monitor actor-monitor actor (current-thread))
```

#### !actor-dead
```scheme
(defmessage !actor-dead (thread))
```

Message sent by actor monitors to notify or a monitored thread exit.


## The Actor Server

### Server Addresses

Actor server addresses can be:
- UNIX domain addresses
- TCP addresses
- TLS addresses.

### Unix Addresses
A UNIX domain address is denoted like this:
```
[unix: hostname path]
```

`hostname` is the name of the host where the server is
accessible and `path` is the socket path; they are both strings.

Actor servers will never try to connect to UNIX addresses in different
hosts.

### TCP Addresses
A TCP address is denoted like this:
```
[tcp: inet-addr]
```

`inet-addr` is an inet address; normally a pair of a host address and a port.
See the [:std/net/address](address.md#internet-addresses) module for more details.

### TLS Addresses

TODO

### current-actor-server
```scheme
(current-actor-server)
```

Parameter denoting the current actor server.

This parameter is set automatically by `start-actor-server!` and
`call-with-ensemble-server`; you don't normally have to set it
manually.

### start-actor-server!
```scheme
(start-actor-server! cookie:     (cookie (get-actor-server-cookie))
                     admin:      (admin (get-admin-pubkey))
                     auth:       (auth #f)
                     addresses:  (addrs [])
                     identifier: (id (make-random-identifier))
                     ensemble:   (known-servers (default-known-servers)))
```

Starts an actor server, sets the `current-actor-server` parameter and
returns the main server thread.
- `cookie` is the ensemble cookie; normally resides in `$GERBIL_PATH/ensemble/cookie`.
  Note that the administrator has to explicitly create a cookie for the ensemble, it is
  not automatically created.
- `admin` is the (optional) administrative public key; normally resindes in
  `$GERBIL_PATH/ensemble/admin.pub`.
- `auth`: a hash table mapping server ids to capabilities; these are preauthorized
  server capabilities.
- `addresses` is the list of addresses the server should listen; by default it is empty,
  making this a transient actor server.
- `identifier` is the server identifier; if you don't specify one, a random server
  identifier will be generated.
- `ensemble` specifies statically known hosts; it is a hash table mapping server identifiers
  to lists of addresses.
  The default known servers only contain the registry with the default registry address.

### stop-actor-server!
```scheme
(stop-actor-server! (srv (current-actor-server)))
```

Stops and joins an actor server.

### actor-server-identifier
```scheme
(actor-server-identifier (srv (current-actor-server)))
```

Returns an actor server's identifier.

### register-actor!
```scheme
(register-actor! name (srv (current-actor-server)))
```

Registers the current thread in an actor server as an actor with the name `name`.

### connect-to-server!
```scheme
(connect-to-server! id (addrs #f) (srv (current-actor-server)))
```

Instructs an actor server to connect to another server.
- `id` is the identifier of the target server
- `addrs` is an optional list of addresses; if none is specified and
  the server is unknown, its addresses will be resolved through the
  ensemble registry.

### list-actors
```scheme
(list-actors (srv (current-actor-server)))
```

Lists the actors registered with an actor server.
Returns a list of references.

### list-connections
```scheme
(list-connections (srv (current-actor-server)))
```

Lists the current connections of an actor server.
Returns an associative list, with the server identifier at the car and the
list of addresses connected at the cdr.

### default-known-servers
```scheme
(default-known-servers)
```

Returns a hash table with the default known servers.
By default it only contains the registry reachable in its default address.

### set-default-known-servers!
```scheme
(set-default-known-servers! servers)
```

Sets the default known servers; `servers` must be a hash table mapping
server identifiers to lists of addresses.

### default-registry-addresses
```scheme
(default-registry-addresses)
```

Returns the default registry addresses, as a list of addresses.  By
default the registry is reachable at `/tmp/ensemble/registry` in the
current host.

### set-default-registry-addresses!
```scheme
(set-default-registry-addresses! addrs)
```

Sets the default registry addresses.

### server-address-cache-ttl
```scheme
(server-address-cache-ttl)
```

Returns the actor's server address cache TTL in seconds (a real number);
by default this is 5 minutes.

### set-server-address-cache-ttl!
```scheme
(set-server-address-cache-ttl! ttl)
```

Sets the actor server's address cache TTL (in seconds, a real number).



## Ensemble Servers

### call-with-ensemble-server
```scheme
(call-with-ensemble-server server-id thunk
                           log-level: (log-level 'INFO)
                           log-file:  (log-file #f)
                           listen:    (listen-addrs [])
                           announce:  (public-addrs #f)
                           registry:  (registry-addrs #f)
                           roles:     (roles [])
                           cookie:    (cookie (get-actor-server-cookie))
                           admin:     (admin (get-admin-pubkey))
                           auth:      (auth #f))
```

This is the programmatic equivalent of `gxensemble run`; first it
starts the logger with the appropriate options, and then it starts a
new actor server with identifier `server-id`, starts the loader
service, adds the server to the ensemble, and then invokes thunk.
When the thunk exits, it shuts down the actor server and removes the
server-id from the ensemble.

Options:
- `log-level`: logging level to use; INFO by default
- `log-file`: log file for the logger; if it is "-" then the canonical
  server log is used; this file is at
  `$GERBIL_PATH/ensemble/server/<server-id>/log`.
- `listen`: a list of addresses for the actor server to listen to, in
  addition to the default unix address.
- `announce`: an optional list of addresses to announce to the registry,
  in addition to the default unix address. If it is not specified, then
  the listen addresses are announced.
- `registry`: an optional list of registry addresses. If it is not specified,
  then the default registry address is used.
- `roles`: a list of roles the server fullfills in the registry.
- `cookie`: the cookie to use; by default it uses the ensemble cooke in
  `$GERBIL_PATH/ensemble/cookie`.
- `admin`: the administrative public key, if any; by default it uses the public
   key in `$GERBIL_PATH/ensemble/admin.pub` if it exists.
- `auth`: a hash table mapping server ids to capabilities; these are preauthorized
  server capabilities.

### ensemble-base-path
```scheme
(ensemble-base-path)
```

Returns the base directory for the ensemble; this is `$GERBIL_PATH/ensemble`.

### ensemble-server-path
```scheme
(ensemble-server-path server-id)
```

Returns the directory for server specific data; this is `$GERBIL_PATH/ensemble/server/<server-id>`.
