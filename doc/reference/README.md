# Introduction

This is the reference documentation for Gerbil.  We aim to
exhaustively document the Scheme primitives, the Gambit primitives, the Gerbil [core prelude](gerbil/prelude/README.md), [runtime builtins](gerbil/runtime/README.md), the
[standard library](std/README.md), and the Meta-[expander context](gerbil/expander/README.md).

The idea of extensive and easy to use documentation is at our forefront. This is still a WIP and there's more to come. If you need certain things now see the [R5RS](https://schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/) document for basic Scheme primitives used as a part of our prelude along with the [Gambit Manual](https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~gambit/doc/gambit.html) for our underlying implementation internals. 

If you're viewing this as a webpage online almost every page has a link whereby you can edit and request a commit. Even if it's just pointing out the issue every part helps.

When information is missing, out of date, or unclear, it's a bug! If you cannot edit try to contact us (by email, on Gitter or GitHub, etc.) and we'll get it done.
