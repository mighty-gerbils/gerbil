# Common Expression Forms

These are common macros used for expressions.

## cond
```
(cond
 <cond-clause> ...
 [(else body ...)])

cond-clause:
 (test => receiver)
 (test body ...)
```

The clauses are processed top down, util a `test` evaluates truthy, in
which case the the expression reduces to the value of the associated
clause body.  If a `test` dispatches to a `receiver` with `=>`, then
the receiver must be a single argument procedure, that receives the
value of the test and conditional expression reduces to the value of
the application of the `receiver` to the value of the `test`. If no
`test` produces a truthy value, then the expression reduces to the
body of the `else` clause. If no `else` clause is present, then the
expression produces a void value.

## and
```
(and expr ...)
```

The boolean conjunction macro.

Evalutes the expressions in order while they reduce to a truthy value;
once a `#f` value is produced, then the value of the `and` expression
is `#f`. If all expressions are truthy, the value of `and` expression
is the value of the last expression. The empty `(and`) reduces to
`#f`.

## or
```
(or expr ...)
```
The boolean disjunction macro.

Conditionally evaluates the expressions in order until one of them
reduces to a truthy value, which becomes the values of the `or`
expression. If no expression produces a truthy value, then the value
of the `or` expression is `#f`. The empty `(and)` reduces to `#t`.

## ?
```
(? <predicate-expr> expr)
(? <predicate-expr>)
(? <predicate-expr> => receiver)
(? <predicate-expr> :: continue)
(? <predicate-expr> :: continue => receiver)

predicate-expr:
 (and <predicate-expr> ...)
 (or  <predicate-expr> ...)
 (not <predicate-expr>)
 <expression>
```

The predicate composition macro:
- `(? <predicate-expr> expr)`, composes a predicate and applies it to `expr`.
- `(? <predicate-expr>)`, creates a new predicate (a procedure of one argument that produces a truthy value) composing the predicate expression.
- `(? <predicate-expr> => receiver) ` creates a new predicate that composes the predicate expression. If the predicate expression on the argument reduces to a truthy value, it the resulting value is applied to the `receiver`.
- `(? <predicate-expr> :: continue)` creates a new predicate that composes the predicate expression; if the predicate argument satisfies the predicate composition, the `continue` procedure is applied to the it.
- `(? <predicate-expr> :: continue => receiver)` creates a new predicate that composes the predicate expression. If the predicate argument satisfies the predicate composition, the result is the application of `receiver` to the result of application of the original o0bject to `continue`.

It is probably easier to understand all this from the actual definition of the macro:
```
(defrules ? (and or not =>)
  ((recur (and pred ...) obj)
   (and (recur pred obj) ...))
  ((recur (or pred ...) obj)
   (or (recur pred obj) ...))
  ((recur (not pred) obj)
   (not (recur pred obj)))
  ((_ pred obj)
   (pred obj))
  ((recur pred)
   (lambda ($obj) (recur pred $obj)))
  ((recur pred => K)
   (lambda ($obj)
     (alet ($val (recur pred $obj))
       (K $val))))
  ((recur pred :: K)
   (lambda ($obj)
     (and (recur pred $obj)
          (K $obj))))
  ((recur pred :: proc => K)
   (lambda ($obj)
     (and (recur pred $obj)
          (K (proc $obj))))))
```

## when
```
(when test expr ...)
=>
(if test (begin expr ...) (void))
```

One arm conditional expression.

## unless
```
(unless test expr ...)
=>
(if test (void) (begin expr ...))
```

Negated one arm conditional expression.

## case
```
(case expr
 <case-clause> ...
 [<else-clause>])

case-clause:
 ((<datum> ...) => receiver)
 ((<datum> ...) expr ...)

else-clause:
 (else => receiver)
 (else expr ...)
```

Evaluates the expression `expr` and dispatches the matching clause
based on the value being in the list of datums of the clause.

Datums can be symbols, characters, numbers, strings, or atoms.


## begin0
```
(begin0 expr rest ...)
=>
(let (val expr)
  rest ...
  val)
```

Evaluates a sequence of expressions and reduces to the value of the
expression.

## @list
```
\[<list-expression-body> ...\]
(@list <list-expression-body> ...)

list-expression-body ...:
 . '<s-expression>
 . `<s-expression>
 . tail
 :: <s-expr>
 <s-expr> \... <list-expression-body> ...
 <s-expr> <list-expression-body> ...
```

The list constructor expression, normally implied with the `[]` reader
macro.

## delay
```
(delay expr)
```

Creates a promise to evaluate `expr` when needed with the `force`
primitive.  The value of the expression is memoized.

## do
TODO

## do-while
TODO


## while
```
(while test body ...)
```

Imperative loop; the body is evaluated while the `test` expression is truthy.

## until
```
(util test body ...)
```

Imperative loop; the body is evaluated until the `test` expression is truthy.
