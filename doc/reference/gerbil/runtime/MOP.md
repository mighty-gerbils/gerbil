(slot-ref obj slot [E]))

  obj  := object
  slot := symbol or keyword
  E    := procedure
```

Returns the value associated with slot *slot* in *obj*.
If the object has no such slot, then *E* is invoked in tail position as `(E obj slot)`.
By default, this raises an error.


### slot-set!
```scheme
(slot-set! obj slot val [E])

  obj  := object
  slot := symbol or keyword
  val  := any
  E    := procedure;
```

Sets the value associated with slot *slot* in *obj* to *val*.
If the object has no such slot, then *E* is invoked in tail position as `(E obj slot)`.
By default, this raises an error.

  obj  := object
  slot := symbol or keyword
```

  obj := object
  id  := symbol; method id
```

Looks up the method with *id* in *obj*'s class hierarchy.

### checked-method-ref
```scheme
(checked-method-ref obj id) -> procedure

  obj := object
  id  := symbol; method id
```

Like `method-ref`, but raises an error if the method is not found.

### bound-method-ref
```scheme
(bound-method-ref obj id) -> procedure | #f

  obj := object
  id  := symbol; method id
```

Looks up the method with *id* in *obj*'s hierarchy and returns
a procedure which applies the method currying the object.

### checked-bound-method-ref
```scheme
(checked-bound-method-ref obj id) -> procedure

  obj := object
  id  := symbol; method id

### bind-specializer!
```scheme
(bind-specializer! method-proc specializer)

  method      := procedure implementing a method
  specializer := procedure of two arguments,  that returns the specialized method

```

Binds a specializer procedure associated with a method. When a class
is sealed or an interface instance prototype is created, the
specializer is invoked with the concrete class and the specialized method
table to generate a version of the method that is specialized for the
concrete class.

**Warning** This is an unsafe procedure.

### seal-class!
```scheme
(seal-class! klass)

  klass := class
```

Seals a class, which must be _final_. Sealing a class specializes and coalesces
all methods in the hierarchy to the class' method table.

(next-method klass obj id) -> procedure | #f

  klass := type-descriptor or builtin record descriptor
  obj   := object
  id    := symbol; method id
