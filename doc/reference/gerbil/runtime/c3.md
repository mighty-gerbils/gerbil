# C3

Below is the documentation for module `gerbil/runtime/c3` and
the C4 linearization algorithm it implements, itself a slight extension of
the well-known C3 linearization algorithm for multiple inheritance.

## The C4 Algorithm

Like C3 of which it is a successor, the C4 linearization algorithm respects
the following four constraints. C3 was actually named after the first three
constraints, omitting to count the 4th, yet implicitly respecting it:

  1. *Linearization* (introduced by Flavors):
     The precedence list returned is a linearization (total order extension)
     of the inheritance DAG (viewed as a partial order).

  2. *Direct Superclass Ordering* (introduced by New Flavors):
     The list of a class's direct super classes, a.k.a. its local precedence list,
     is a sublist of its precedence list (seen as an order, i.e. all elements
     are present in the same order but not necessarily consecutively).

  3. *Monotonicity* (introduced by Ducournau et al. 1992 as "monotonic linearization"):
     A class's precedence list is included as a sublist
     (seen as an order, same as above)
     in the precedence list of each of its subclasses.

  4. *Shape Determinism* (introduced by Ducournau et al. 1994 as "acceptability"):
     The precedence list must only depend on the *shape* of the inheritance graph
     (inheritance graphs isomorphic up to some renaming should yield identical
     precedence lists up to the very same renaming).

Additionally, C4 extends C3 with support for structs that require single-inheritance,
by adding the following constraint:

  5. *Struct Suffix* (first implicitly recognized by Scala 3?):
     A struct's precedence list is a suffix
     of the precedence list of its subclasses.

Finally, C4 uses the following heuristic, same as C3, to deterministically compute
the precedence list in cases that multiple solutions satisfy the above constraints:

  6. *Depth-First Traversal*:
     When the above constraints do not suffice to uniquely determine the next element
     in the precedence list, a choice is made between multiple candidates, and,
     given Shape Determinism and the other constraints above, this choice must be based on
     a *traversal* of the list of precedence lists from direct superclasses.
     As per the C3 algorithm, we build precedence list head-first with a depth-first traversal;
     this is equivalent to building the precedence list tail-first with the reverse traversal.
     A different traversal for instance would be depth-first, but there are good reasons to pick
     depth-first, notably in perserving as much as possible the tail of the precedence list,
     thereby maximizing sharing of partial semantics in methods and slots.

*PS*: Common Lisp, and the earlier tradition of multiple inheritance, that we
follow here, all the way back to Flavors, calls "classes" the things with
multiple inheritance and "structs" the things with single inheritance only.
Smalltalk and after it Java, and the earlier and historically more prevalent
tradition of single inheritance, calls "classes" the things with single
inheritance and "traits" the things with multiple inheritance (after Mesa).
C++ only has multiple inheritance (though duplicating non-virtual superclasses
more like mixin inheritance), and calls "struct" a class where all "members"
are public by default. Wonderful nomenclature, right?

## Procedures

### c4-linearize
```scheme
(c4-linearize rhead supers
  get-precedence-list: get-precedence-list
  struct: struct?
  [eq: eq?]
  [get-name: get-name]) -> (values list (or class #f))
```

Compute the class precedence list of a class, given its super-classes and additional information.
This function takes two positional arguments,
two compulsory keyword arguments `get-precedence-list:` and `struct:`,
and two optional keyword arguments `eq:` (defaults to `eq?`) and
`get-name` (defaults to the `identity` function).
It returns two values, the precedence list from most-specific to least-specific,
and the most specific superclass that is a `struct`, or `#f` if none is found.

The function abstracts over the type `X` of class descriptors used for input and output,
that it only access via the values and functions passed as arguments:

  - `rhead` is a list of `X`, the reverse of a prefix to the precedence list.
    Its value will be prepended to the list as computed.
    In typical uses, `rhead` is either an empty list, or a singleton list containing
    the class descriptor for the class whose precedence list is being computed.

  - `supers` is a list of `X`, class descriptors for direct super-classes of the one being defined.
    In typical uses, `supers` will be `(direct-supers x)` where `x` is the class for which
    the precedence list is being computed.

  - `get-precedence-list:` specifies a procedure that, given a class descriptor `c` of type `X`
    for a direct super-class of the class at stake, returns the precedence list of `c`,
    from most-specific to least-specific, with `c` included at the start.

  - `struct:` specifies a predicate that, given a class descriptor `c` of type `X` (as above),
    returns true if the class is a “struct”, subject to the *suffix constraint*
    (see section with that name above).

  - `eq:` (optional, defaults to `eq?`) specifies what predicate to use
    to compare class descriptors of type `X` for equality.

  - `get-name:` (optional, defaults to the `identity` function) specifies what function to use
    to print the name of a class descriptor of type `X` in case an inheritance inconsistency is detected,
    and an error message must be printed.

The precedence lists involved are ordered from most-specific class first
to least-specific class last (with the base class at the end).

An error is raised if there is an inconsistency in the inheritance DAG
such that no linearization exists that satisfies the four constraints.
