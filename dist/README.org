#+TITLE: Distributing Gerbil

Gerbil is a simple language and runtime that can be distributed many
ways. This is where any extra items exist in the source tree so anyone
can see how things work in other streams.

* MacOS

There are those of us that got sucked into MacOS. It's a UNIX, so
there's that. Anyway there's a few different approaches and they're
outlined [[file:macos/README.org][here]].

* Docker

There's some docker things that I don't understand (lol) [[file:docker][here]].

* Guix

At one point I(drewc) was using Guix. My work on it is [[file:guix/README.org][here]].
