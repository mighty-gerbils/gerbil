#+TITLE: Distributing Gerbil

Gerbil is a simple language and runtime that can be distributed many
ways. Because we're still < 1.0 when it comes to release and also used
by many in production there does need to be a fairly easy way to use
and/or package gerbil.

This is where such things exist as well as come to meet. 

* Supported distributions and architectures

While most people will use a pre-packaged Gerbil, especially after we
hit 1.0, some may want to build the HEAD in master either to
contribute or because we have yet to point release a feature.


* MacOS

There are those of us that got sucked into MacOS. It's a UNIX, so
there's that. Anyway there's a few different approaches and they're
outlined [[file:macos/README.org][here]].

* Docker

There's some docker things that I don't understand (lol) [[file:docker][here]].

* Guix

At one point I(drewc) was using Guix. My work on it is [[file:guix/README.org][here]].

* The TODO tree

** TODO Look at nfpm?

nFPM is Not FPM - a zero dependencies, simple deb, rpm, apk, ipk, and arch linux packager written in Go.

Why?

While fpm is great, for me, it is a bummer that it depends on ruby,
tar and other software.

I wanted something that could be used as a binary and/or as a library and that was really simple.

So I decided to create nFPM: a simpler, 0-dependency,
as-little-assumptions-as-possible alternative to fpm.
