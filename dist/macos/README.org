* Gerbil on MacOS

MacOS is well supported by gerbil.

  - If you've got [[https://brew.sh/][Homebrew]] you can use the [[#homebrew-formula-and-binaries][Tap and/or Formula]].
  - If you've got some time to spare it can [[#raw-build][be built]] easily.
    
Because there are many different versions and processors your
configuration may be slightly different than expected. If anything at
all seems out of the ordinary please [[https://github.com/mighty-gerbils/gerbil/issues][file an issue]] ot get in touch
another way and we'll be on top of it.

* Homebrew Formula and Binaries
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: homebrew-formula-and-binaries
:END:

The simple way is to use the [[https://github.com/mighty-gerbils/homebrew-gerbil][Homebrew Tap]].

There are binaries as well as the ability to build the HEAD of master.

#+begin_src sh
brew install mighty-gerbils/gerbil/gerbil-scheme
#+end_src

That repository is also available in the gerbil source [[file:homebrew/README.org][as a subtree]].

#+begin_src sh
   git subtree add --prefix macos/homebrew git@github.com:mighty-gerbils/homebrew-gerbil.git main --squash
#+end_src

* Build from source
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: raw-build
:END:

There are a few different ways to build a working =gerbil= on =MacOS=.

** Install Dependencies

 - Install XCode :: Open a terminal and run ~xcode-select --install~

 - Compile and Install OpenSSL :: We need it for crypto so cannot use
   the built in ssl.
   #+begin_src sh
     git clone https://github.com/openssl/openssl.git
     cd openssl;
     ./config && make
     sudo make install
   #+end_src

   
** Using GCC@14

If you want a faster compile time both for building =gerbil= and your
own binaries =gcc= is the better idea. =GERBIL_GCC= should allow you
to compile your own binaries with a different compiler if you ever
need to use the weird MacOS headers that are not quite C.

You can install it using [[https://www.macports.org/][MacPorts]] or [[https://brew.sh/][Homebrew]].

*** MacPorts

#+begin_src sh
  sudo port -v install gcc14
  mp () {
      echo "/opt/local/bin/$1"
  }

  export CC="$(mp gcc-mp-14)"
  export GERBIL_GCC="$CC"
  export CXX="$(mp g++-mp-14)"
  export LDFLAGS='-Wl,-ld_classic'
  export GERBIL_BUILD_CORES=4

  cd $(mktemp -d);

  git clone https://github.com/mighty-gerbils/gerbil.git

  cd gerbil;
  ./configure --prefix=/opt/gerbil && make -j$GERBIL_BUILD_CORES
  sudo make install

#+end_src

*** Homebrew

#+begin_src sh
  brew install gcc@14
  bp () {
    echo $(brew --prefix gcc@14)/bin/$1
  }
  export CC="$(bp gcc-14)"
  export GERBIL_GCC="$(bp gcc-14)"
  export CXX="$(bp g++-14)"
  export LDFLAGS='-Wl,-ld_classic'
  export GERBIL_BUILD_CORES=4

  cd $(mktemp -d);

  git clone https://github.com/mighty-gerbils/gerbil.git

  cd gerbil;
  ./configure --prefix=/opt/gerbil && make -j$GERBIL_BUILD_CORES
  sudo make install

#+end_src

** Option 2) Use the built in Clang.

If you want to be as native as possible this is the easy way. Most of
us have MacPorts and/or Homebrew and I can totally recommend using
GCC, but once you have openssl this *should* work.

This takes a long time as =clang= is a lot slower to build. But the
binary may outperform modern =gcc= and building binaries with =clang=
without setting =GERBIL_GCC= is something so it's a toss up.

   #+begin_src sh
     git clone https://github.com/mighty-gerbils/gerbil.git

     # On Sonama, Silicon not Intel, we set the prefix as so.
     # You may want it elsewhere.
     cd gerbil;
     ./configure --prefix=/opt/gerbil && make
     sudo make install
   #+end_src


** Option 3) Using a more recent Clang

Especially for an older Mac where the built in =clang= is ancient but
we want some Objective-C like things that apple uses.

You can install it using [[https://www.macports.org/][MacPorts]] or [[https://brew.sh/][Homebrew]].

*** MacPorts

#+begin_src sh
  sudo port -v install clang-18
  mp () {
      echo "/opt/local/bin/$1"
  }
  export CC="$(mp clang-mp-18)"
  export GERBIL_GCC="$(mp clang-mp-18)"
  export CXX="$(mp clang++-mp-18)"
  export LDFLAGS='-Wl,-ld_classic'
  export GERBIL_BUILD_CORES=4

  cd $(mktemp -d);

  git clone https://github.com/mighty-gerbils/gerbil.git

  cd gerbil;
  ./configure --prefix=/opt/gerbil && make -j$GERBIL_BUILD_CORES
  sudo make install

#+end_src


*** Homebrew

#+begin_src sh
  brew install llvm@17
  bp () {
    echo $(brew --prefix llvm@17)/bin/$1
  }
  export CC="$(bp clang)"
  export GERBIL_GCC="$(bp clang)"
  export CXX="$(bp clang++)"
  export LDFLAGS='-Wl,-ld_classic'
  export GERBIL_BUILD_CORES=4

  cd $(mktemp -d);

  git clone https://github.com/mighty-gerbils/gerbil.git

  cd gerbil;
  ./configure --prefix=/opt/gerbil && make -j$GERBIL_BUILD_CORES
  sudo make install

#+end_src

** Location and usage.

 We now have the lastest gerbil setup in the default manner. The
 symlinks and paths are for our usage. Gerbil will, by default, look
 in the directory where it is installed always.

 So, in this example, the =current/= gerbil is in fact
 =v0.18.1-51-gd9c691b1/=. This allows us to have different versions
 installed and used while also giving us some =$PATH='s for running
 and including and linking.
