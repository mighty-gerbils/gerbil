;; Use it from a fully committed git tree.
;;
;; If a release version is specified (vX.Y or vX.Y.Z, numeric only),
;; a new release commit is made and tagged.
;; If a development version is specified (vX.Y-DEV), a new development commit is made and tagged.
;;
;; If no version is specified, one is autodetected:
;; If the current commit is a development commit, a release commit will be made and tagged
;; If the current commit is a release commit, a development commit will be made and tagged
;; e.g. v0.12-DEV-666-g1234567 will be turned into v0.12
;; and v0.13 will be turned into v0.14-DEV
