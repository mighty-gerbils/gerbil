;;; The C3 Linearization algorithm to topologically sort an inheritance DAG
;;; into a precedence list such that:
;;;  1. The precedence list is a linearization of the inheritance DAG
;;;  2. Every precedence list includes as a sublist the precedence list of every super
;;;  3. The list of supers is a sublist of the precedence list
;;;  4. The elements that appear earlier in the list of precedence lists followed by
;;;     the super list appear earlier in the precedence list.
;;;     (This heuristic choice of an order makes the linearization deterministic).
;;; In the above, sublist means that the super list includes all the sublist elements
;;; in the same order but not necessarily consecutively.
;;;
;;; C3 has since been adopted for multiple inheritance by many modern object systems
;;; for its ordering consistency properties:
;;; OpenDylan, Python, Raku, Parrot, Solidity, PGF/TikZ.

;; - rhead is [x] or [] depending on whether to include x as head of the result.
;; - supers is (get-supers x), the list of direct supers of x
;; - get-precedence-list gets the precedence list for a super s, including s itself in front
;; - eqpred is an equality predicate between list elements
;;   (passed around because somehow equal? doesn't work correctly on runtime type-descriptors).
;; - get-name gets the name of a object/class, for debugging only.
