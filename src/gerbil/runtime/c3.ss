;; C5 linearization algorithm: given a top object x from which to compute the precedence list,
;; - rhead is the reverse of a prefix for the precedence list, typically [x] or []
;;   depending on whether to include x as head of the result.
;; - supers the list of direct supers of x, typically (get-supers x)
;; - get-precedence-list gets the precedence list for a super s, including s itself in front
;; - struct is a predicate that tells if a class follows single inheritance, and
;;   must have its precedence list be a suffix of any subclass' precedence list.
;; - eq is an equality predicate between list elements
;; - get-name gets the name of a object/class, for debugging only.
;; Returns the linearized precedence list, and the most specific struct superclass if any
;; : (List X) (List X) \
;;  get-precedence-list: (X -> (NonEmptyList X)) \
;;  struct: (X -> Bool) \
;;  eq: ?(X X -> Bool) \
;;  get-name: ?(X -> Y) \
;; -> (List X) (OrFalse X)
