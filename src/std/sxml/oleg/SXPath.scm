;			XML processing in Scheme
;		     SXPath -- SXML Query Language
;
; SXPath is a query language for SXML, an instance of XML Information
; set (Infoset) in the form of s-expressions. See SSAX.scm for the
; definition of SXML and more details. SXPath is also a translation into
; Scheme of an XML Path Language, XPath:
;	http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath
; XPath and SXPath describe means of selecting a set of Infoset's items
; or their properties.
;
; To facilitate queries, XPath maps the XML Infoset into an explicit
; tree, and introduces important notions of a location path and a
; current, context node. A location path denotes a selection of a set of
; nodes relative to a context node. Any XPath tree has a distinguished,
; root node -- which serves as the context node for absolute location
; paths. Location path is recursively defined as a location step joined
; with a location path. A location step is a simple query of the
; database relative to a context node. A step may include expressions
; that further filter the selected set. Each node in the resulting set
; is used as a context node for the adjoining location path. The result
; of the step is a union of the sets returned by the latter location
; paths.
;
; The SXML representation of the XML Infoset (see SSAX.scm) is rather
; suitable for querying as it is. Bowing to the XPath specification,
; we will refer to SXML information items as 'Nodes':
; 	<Node> ::= <Element> | <attributes-coll> | <attrib>
; 		   | "text string" | <PI>
; This production can also be described as
;	<Node> ::= (name . <Nodeset>) | "text string"
; An (ordered) set of nodes is just a list of the constituent nodes:
; 	<Nodeset> ::= (<Node> ...)
; Nodesets, and Nodes other than text strings are both lists. A
; <Nodeset> however is either an empty list, or a list whose head is not
; a symbol.  A symbol at the head of a node is either an XML name (in
; which case it's a tag of an XML element), or an administrative name
; such as '@'.  This uniform list representation makes processing rather
; simple and elegant, while avoiding confusion. The multi-branch tree
; structure formed by the mutually-recursive datatypes <Node> and
; <Nodeset> lends itself well to processing by functional languages.
;
; A location path is in fact a composite query over an XPath tree or
; its branch. A singe step is a combination of a projection, selection
; or a transitive closure. Multiple steps are combined via join and
; union operations. This insight allows us to _elegantly_ implement
; XPath as a sequence of projection and filtering primitives --
; converters -- joined by _combinators_. Each converter takes a node
; and returns a nodeset which is the result of the corresponding query
; relative to that node. A converter can also be called on a set of
; nodes. In that case it returns a union of the corresponding queries over
; each node in the set. The union is easily implemented as a list
; append operation as all nodes in a SXML tree are considered
; distinct, by XPath conventions. We also preserve the order of the
; members in the union. Query combinators are high-order functions:
; they take converter(s) (which is a Node|Nodeset -> Nodeset function)
; and compose or otherwise combine them. We will be concerned with
; only relative location paths [XPath]: an absolute location path is a
; relative path applied to the root node.
;
; Similarly to XPath, SXPath defines full and abbreviated notations
; for location paths. In both cases, the abbreviated notation can be
; mechanically expanded into the full form by simple rewriting
; rules. In case of SXPath the corresponding rules are given as
; comments to a sxpath function, below. The regression test suite at
; the end of this file shows a representative sample of SXPaths in
; both notations, juxtaposed with the corresponding XPath
; expressions. Most of the samples are borrowed literally from the
; XPath specification, while the others are adjusted for our running
; example, tree1.
;

; Rename filter to node-filter or ns-filter
; Use ;=== for chapters, ;--- for sections, and ;^^^ for end sections

;-------------------------
; Basic converters and applicators
; A converter is a function
;	type Converter = Node|Nodeset -> Nodeset
; A converter can also play a role of a predicate: in that case, if a
; converter, applied to a node or a nodeset, yields a non-empty
; nodeset, the converter-predicate is deemed satisfied. Throughout
; this file a nil nodeset is equivalent to #f in denoting a failure.

; The following function implements a 'Node test' as defined in
; Sec. 2.3 of XPath document. A node test is one of the components of a
; location step. It is also a converter-predicate in SXPath.
;
; The function node-typeof? takes a type criterion and returns a function,
; which, when applied to a node, will tell if the node satisfies
; the test.
;	node-typeof? :: Crit -> Node -> Boolean
;
; The criterion 'crit' is a symbol, one of the following:
;	id		- tests if the Node has the right name (id)
;	@		- tests if the Node is an <attributes-coll>
;	*		- tests if the Node is an <Element>
;	*text*		- tests if the Node is a text node
;	*PI*		- tests if the Node is a PI node
;	*any*		- #t for any type of Node

; Converter combinators
;
; Combinators are higher-order functions that transmogrify a converter
; or glue a sequence of converters into a single, non-trivial
; converter. The goal is to arrive at converters that correspond to
; XPath location paths.
;
; From a different point of view, a combinator is a fixed, named
; _pattern_ of applying converters. Given below is a complete set of
; such patterns that together implement XPath location path
; specification. As it turns out, all these combinators can be built
; from a small number of basic blocks: regular functional composition,
; map-union and filter applicators, and the nodeset union.



; select-kids:: Pred -> Node -> Nodeset
; Given a Node, return an (ordered) subset its children that satisfy
; the Pred (a converter, actually)
; select-kids:: Pred -> Nodeset -> Nodeset
; The same as above, but select among children of all the nodes in
; the Nodeset
;
; More succinctly, the signature of this function is
; select-kids:: Converter -> Converter

(define (select-kids test-pred?)
  (lambda (node)		; node or node-set
    (cond
     ((null? node) node)
     ((not (pair? node)) '())   ; No children
     ((symbol? (car node))
      ((filter test-pred?) (cdr node)))	; it's a single node
     (else (map-union (select-kids test-pred?) node)))))


; node-self:: Pred -> Node -> Nodeset, or
; node-self:: Converter -> Converter
; Similar to select-kids but apply to the Node itself rather
; than to its children. The resulting Nodeset will contain either one
; component, or will be empty (if the Node failed the Pred).
(define node-self filter)


; node-join:: [LocPath] -> Node|Nodeset -> Nodeset, or
; node-join:: [Converter] -> Converter
; join the sequence of location steps or paths as described
; in the title comments above.
(define (node-join . selectors)
  (lambda (nodeset)		; Nodeset or node
    (let loop ((nodeset nodeset) (selectors selectors))
      (if (null? selectors) nodeset
	  (loop
	   (if (nodeset? nodeset)
	       (map-union (car selectors) nodeset)
	       ((car selectors) nodeset))
	   (cdr selectors))))))


; node-reduce:: [LocPath] -> Node|Nodeset -> Nodeset, or
; node-reduce:: [Converter] -> Converter
; A regular functional composition of converters.
; From a different point of view,
;    ((apply node-reduce converters) nodeset)
; is equivalent to
;    (foldl apply nodeset converters)
; i.e., folding, or reducing, a list of converters with the nodeset
; as a seed.
(define (node-reduce . converters)
  (lambda (nodeset)		; Nodeset or node
    (let loop ((nodeset nodeset) (converters converters))
      (if (null? converters) nodeset
	  (loop ((car converters) nodeset) (cdr converters))))))


; node-or:: [Converter] -> Converter
; This combinator applies all converters to a given node and
; produces the union of their results.
; This combinator corresponds to a union, '|' operation for XPath
; location paths.
; (define (node-or . converters)
;   (lambda (node-or-nodeset)
;     (if (null? converters) node-or-nodeset
; 	(append
; 	 ((car converters) node-or-nodeset)
; 	 ((apply node-or (cdr converters)) node-or-nodeset)))))
; More optimal implementation follows
(define (node-or . converters)
  (lambda (node-or-nodeset)
    (let loop ((result '()) (converters converters))
      (if (null? converters) result
	  (loop (append result (or ((car converters) node-or-nodeset) '()))
		(cdr converters))))))


; node-closure:: Converter -> Converter
; Select all _descendants_ of a node that satisfy a converter-predicate.
; This combinator is similar to select-kids but applies to
; grand... children as well.
; This combinator implements the "descendant::" XPath axis
; Conceptually, this combinator can be expressed as
; (define (node-closure f)
;      (node-or
;        (select-kids f)
;	 (node-reduce (select-kids (node-typeof? '*)) (node-closure f))))
; This definition, as written, looks somewhat like a fixpoint, and it
; will run forever. It is obvious however that sooner or later
; (select-kids (node-typeof? '*)) will return an empty nodeset. At
; this point further iterations will no longer affect the result and
; can be stopped.

(define (node-closure test-pred?)
  (lambda (node)		; Nodeset or node
    (let loop ((parent node) (result '()))
      (if (null? parent) result
	  (loop ((select-kids (node-typeof? '*)) parent)
		(append result
			((select-kids test-pred?) parent)))
	  ))))

; node-parent:: RootNode -> Converter
; (node-parent rootnode) yields a converter that returns a parent of a
; node it is applied to. If applied to a nodeset, it returns the list
; of parents of nodes in the nodeset. The rootnode does not have
; to be the root node of the whole SXML tree -- it may be a root node
; of a branch of interest.
; Given the notation of Philip Wadler's paper on semantics of XSLT,
;  parent(x) = { y | y=subnode*(root), x=subnode(y) }
; Therefore, node-parent is not the fundamental converter: it can be
; expressed through the existing ones.  Yet node-parent is a rather
; convenient converter. It corresponds to a parent:: axis of SXPath.
; Note that the parent:: axis can be used with an attribute node as well!

(define (node-parent rootnode)
  (lambda (node)		; Nodeset or node
    (if (nodeset? node) (map-union (node-parent rootnode) node)
	(let ((pred
	       (node-or
		(node-reduce
		 (node-self (node-typeof? '*))
		 (select-kids (node-eq? node)))
		(node-join
		 (select-kids (node-typeof? '@))
		 (select-kids (node-eq? node))))))
