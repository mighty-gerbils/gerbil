;; Synchronously run a command in a (sub)process.
;; The command is a list [path . arguments] to be processed by Gambit's open-process.
;; The coprocess: argument specifies how Gerbil interacts with the process;
;; it is a function that will be called with the Gambit process object as only argument;
;; the result of that function will be returned by run-process.
;; The default coprocess is the function std/misc/ports#read-all-as-string,
;; that will read the process's entire output as a string.
;; If the check-status: argument is a procedure then when the process has
;; completed it is called with the exit status and the list of arguments passed
;; to gerbil/gambit/ports#open-process used to create the process. If it is
;; true, then the process exit status will be checked, and an error will be
;; raised if it isn't 0. If it is false, then the exit status is not checked.
;; Other arguments are passed through to gerbil/gambit/ports#open-process.
;; They have the same defaults as per gambit, except for the show-console: argument
;; that defaults to #f, the Gambit default.
;; I (fare) consider that scripting is more common than user-interaction, and that
;; user-interaction is what should have a big flashing non-default argument screaming at you.
;; That is also coherent with the above pseudo-terminal: default to #f, BTW.
