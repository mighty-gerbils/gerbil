;;; Atoms in the style of clojure: shared, synchronous, independent state

;; NB: Compared to the Clojure atom API, we:
;; - Do not support the meta field and the functions alter-meta! reset-meta!
;; - Replace swap-vals! and reset-vals! by swap-values! and reset-values!
;;   returning values rather than vectors.
;; - Rename add-watch and remove-watch to add-watch! and remove-watch!
;; - Do not have generic functions that work on multiple kinds of "references"
;;   but only one set of functions for atoms.
;; - Also export atom-increment! and atomic-counter for the common case.
